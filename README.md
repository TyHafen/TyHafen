Hello!
 My name is Ty Hafen and I am currently studying to become a software developer at Boise CodeWorks! I previously come from a background in brewing where I applied my BS in biology. I love problem solving, bcritical thinking, and being able to express myself. These three traits led me to software development! My hobbies include skiing, backpacking, or any way of getting myself out and into nature. There is no better place to feel alive than when you are out in the middle of it all!
