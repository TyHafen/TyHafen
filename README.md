Hello! My name is Ty Hafen and I am a Software Developer based out of Redwood City, California. I obtained a Certification for Software Development through Boise CodeWorks, an immserive fullstack course located in Boise, Idaho and am looking for work in web development or to collaborate on a project. I am a highly motivated individual who loves to learn and through my GitHub you will see what I can accomplish relatively fast. I enjoy every aspect of Fullstack development, from front to back. JavaScript and C# are my primary languages, as I am currently regaining my Python abilities.  Every fullstack application I build follows the MVC pattern of design using VUE.js . My biggest passion within coding lies with backend work. I love utilizing data and creating the ability to have it come to life  within an application. I find this aspect of development fascinating and it is what I am trying to make a career out of. I'm fluent in Node.js utilizing express and MongoDB and ASP.NET paired with mySQL.
