STRENGTHS 
 - I am very hard headed in the fact that I do not like to stop working until I have figured it out or know that I am wasting time. I love the feeling of being exhausted , fatigued and drained after knowing I did something productive.

 - I am unique in the fact that while I love working hard and putting my best foot forward, I also enjoy having a smile on my face the entire time. Life is about happiness and fullfillment.

 - I have always been good abut helping others in a work environement. I do not mind over burdening myself to help someone else get to where they need to be. We all need a helping hand at times.

WEAKNESSES
 - when i get frustrated I get very very frustrated. I get extremely down on myself because i put so much pressure on everything I do. I dont ever need to be the best, but i feel like I have to be better than average.

 - sometimes i feel  no matter what I cant focus on the positives when Im down. Like I cant be optomisitic towards my own growth.

 - At times I can be overly critical and create ridiculous standards for others. i have been known to do this in my daily life, but only for people I do not understand. If I get along well with you then its easy for me to not analyis anything, If i am off put by someoe I become very judgy towards how they operate.
 
OPPORTUNITIES
 
 - I feel like where the workforce is moving today, that we are in a perfect time to reinvent ourselves. Tech is becoming even bigger and within this industry all of the things I could ask for are releveant (good pay, remote work, flexible schedule)

 - Trends I can take advantage of are not always having a need for traditional schooling. I have a Bachelors and I havent used it once since I got it.

 - I know that if  I can not only shoe my abilities but also who I am as a person I will have a great opportunity to be placed in a career that I love.
 
THREATS

- something that could harm me is being turned away, I do not like 'losing' and if someone doesnt see me as a potential asset, yet I see them as one (like a job I really want) I take that ery much to heart.

- I feel like my competetion is just one step ahead of me, putting in more hours, being smarter and naturally more intuitive than me. I never need to be the bestm I just hate being last.

- Threats that my weaknesses expose me to are being so negative that I close the doors of opportunity myself without even walking through them. Im so scared of change for the bad that I dont allow changes of good.
